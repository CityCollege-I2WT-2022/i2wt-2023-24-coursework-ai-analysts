        <h1>Five nights at freddy's 2</h1>
        
        <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        
        <p>
        Released in November 11th 2014, a few months after the first game, Five nights at freddy's 2 takes place in 1987, an important date in the universe, making it a prequel to the first game. Once again you play as a night-guard in the now soon closing Freddy Fazbears Pizza. Besides being a prequel in the story of the game, it has every right to be considered a sequel as it is bigger in every way compared to its predecessor, more animatronics, a bigger location and more mechanics. However, despite its scale it still plays similarly to the original, only this time, you don't have any doors to lock. The office consists of one big hallway infront of you and two vents on your left and right that the animatronics will use to get to you. This time the animatronics number has doubled, they are:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Toy Freddy</li>
            <li>Toy Chica</li>
            <li>Toy Bonnie</li>
            <li>Mangle</li>
            <li>The Puppet</li>
            <li>Withered Freddy</li>
            <li>Withered Bonnie</li>
            <li>Withered Chica</li>
            <li>Withered Foxy</li>
            <li>Withered Golden Freddy</li>
            <li>Baloon Boy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Yeah, that's a lot of animatronics, and the bad news don't end there. Your only means to survive are a spare freddy head to confuse the animatronics and a limited flashlight for Withered Foxy specifically. Furthermore, in order to prevent the Marionette from attacking, you need to wind a music box through the camera. It's pretty clear, the challenge in this game has sagnifically increased and, again, you need to survive five nights. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>AI</h3>
        <p>AI in five night's at freddy's 2 follows the same movement opportunity system from five nights at freddy's with the animatronics apart from two animatronics. However, unlike the first game, all animatronics take 5 seconds to make a move. Their behaviours are also intresting. Toy chica, Toy bonnie, Withered Bonnie and Withered Chica make their way trough their respective sides of the building(toy chica and withered bonnie left, toy bonnie and withered chica right) and enter the office through the vents of the side they roam(Note!: The withereds don't attack from the vents and instead enter the office first, toy chica will attack from the vents and toy bonnie is kind of a combination of the two), they can also be seen in the hallway apart from toy bonnie. Mangle will go through the right side of the building and enter the right vent, if the attack is scuccessful she'll hang in the cealling and then attack(she is also visible in the hallway). Ballon Boy will eithergo through the left side and enter the left vent or immediately teleport to left vent, he's intresting to say the least. Lastly withered foxy will enter the hall from the parts and service room and marionette(if the music box winds down) will move through the center and attack from the hall. Anyway, before we get into how nights play out, it's important to explain how these these specific animatonics work:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Marionette</li>
        <li>Withered Foxy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Marionette is quite special, mostly because its character AI level doesn't determine how fast the music box winds down, it only determines how fast it reaches the office after the timer's over. What actually determines that is a preset number that is set each night. That number is 2000, then every 50 milliseconds a value is subtracted from the timer. This changes every night.In night 1 it's 2, in night 2 it's the same, in night 3 it's 3, in night 4 it's 4, in night 5 it's 5 and in night 6 and 7 it's 6.</p>
        
        <p>Withered Foxy is complicated. Apart from the movement opportunity he also has an alternate value that basically has to do with failed movements. Basically, every time Foxy fails a movement the more the chance for a successful movement. Using the flashlight, even when Foxy isn't in the office, resets this counter. If the movement opportunity is successful, Foxy will enter the hallway, wait for his attack counter(Which is 50) to drop to 0 and then the player will get jumpscared. Shining your light will increase a flashlight counter. If this counter is bigger than 100, all of Foxy's counters are reset. apart from his attack counter which generates a random number to count down from, which will reset to 50 once he enters the hallway again. Yeah, let's say Foxy is much more complicated than the original, making him extremely intresting. </p>
        
        <p>Anyway the AI of the rest of the animatronics follows the opportunity movement system making them much easier to understand</p>

        <p>Like the first game, after the fifth night you get paid and are finished with the first five nights, however, it wouldn't be a five nights at freddy's game without a sixth night right? This night, by all standards, is extremely difficult but, that's expected, being the final challenge before the infamous Golden Freddy challenge in the custom night</p>
        
        <li>Night 6:<br>
            T.Bonnie AI level: 5<br>
            T.Chica AI level: 5<br>
            T.Freddy AI level: 5<br>
            Mangle AI level: 3-10<br>
            Balloon Boy AI level: 5-9<br>
            W.Bonnie AI level: 5-10<br>
            W.Chica AI level: 5-10<br>
            W.Freddy AI level: 5-10<br>
            W.Foxy AI level: 10-15<br>
            W.Golden Freddy AI chance to appear: 0.1%-3<br>
            Marionette AI level: 15
            </li><br>
        
        <h4>Custom night:</h4>
        <p>After finishing the sixth night you unlock the custom night with its hardest challenge being Golden Freddy, which is basically 10/20 mode. Of course that means, that all animatronics are on the AI level of 20 making this the hardest final challenge in the five night's at freddy's franchise, at least before ultimate custom night released. After beating this challenge you are promptly fired and have succesfully finished five nights at freddy's 2.</p>
