        In Jule 24th 2015 Five nights at freddy's 4 was released. Originally the franchise was supposed to end wit Five nights at freddy's 3 however, fans complained about the jumpscares and the fear factor of the game, so Scott, not wanting the franchise to end with a sour conclusion, made this game. Five nights at freddy's 4 is widly regarded as the scariest in the franchise and for good reason. The atmosphere that this game creates is unmatched by most of the games. In this game you don't play as a security guard, instead you play as a kid trapped in it's room and defending themselves from nightmarish versions of our beloved animatronics. These nightmares are:

        <ul>
        <li>Nightmare Freddy</li>
        <li>Nightmare Bonnie</li>
        <li>Nightmare Chica</li>
        <li>Nightmare Foxy</li>
        <li>Plushtrap</li>
        <li>Nightmare Fredbear</li>
        <li>Nightmare</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        The room consists of two bedroom doors that lead to the left and right hallway, a closet and a bed. You have to check every single one of these spots if you want to survive. Another issue is that the room is plunged in darkness, your only light is a flashlight and its your only "weapon" against the nightmares however, you need to be careful when you flash your light in the hallways, because your either gonna scare them away or get a loud jumpscare which will lead to your death. Which is why its so important to listen for their breathing before opening the flashlight. You see, the game immediately makes it clear that it's important to listen to the breathing and, if you do, close the door. But, the doors aren't they only thing that should worry the player. Nightmare Freddy is behind the player on the bed, while on the closet Foxy lurks. There's more to this that will be expanded upon in the AI section. But, even if you make it through the night, it's not over yet, ther's a plushtrap mini game, that if you beat you get to skip two hours of the next night (Note: This skip will dissapear if you lose or quit the game). So, with the question taking a more terrifying tone, can you survive?
