        Released in November 11th 2014, a few months after the first game, Five nights at freddy's 2 takes place in 1987, an important date in the universe, making it a prequel to the first game. Once again you play as a night-guard in the now soon closing Freddy Fazbears Pizza. Besides being a prequel in the story of the game, it has every right to be considered a sequel as it is bigger in every way compared to its predecessor, more animatronics, a bigger location and more mechanics. However, despite its scale it still plays similarly to the original, only this time, you don't have any doors to lock. The office consists of one big hallway infront of you and two vents on your left and right that the animatronics will use to get to you. This time the animatronics number has doubled, they are:

        <ul>
            <li>Toy Freddy</li>
            <li>Toy Chica</li>
            <li>Toy Bonnie</li>
            <li>Mangle</li>
            <li>The Puppet</li>
            <li>Withered Freddy</li>
            <li>Withered Chica</li>
            <li>Withered Foxy</li>
            <li>Withered Golden Freddy</li>
            <li>Baloon Boy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Yeah, that's a lot of animatronics, and the bad news don't end there. Your only means to survive are a spare freddy head to confuse the animatronics and a limited flashlight for Withered Foxy specifically. Furthermore, in order to prevent the puppet from attacking, you need to wind a music box through the camera. It's pretty clear, the challenge in this game has sagnifically increased and, again, you need to survive five nights.
