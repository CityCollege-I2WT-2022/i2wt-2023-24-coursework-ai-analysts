        <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        <p>
            Five nights at freddy's: Pizzeria Simulator was released in December 4th 2017, originally posing as an innocent 8-bit pizzeria tycoon game giving player's quite a suprise when they realised it is actually Five nights at feddy's 6. You are now a manager of your own pizzeria making financial decisions and trying to run your restaurant until Saturday when a big party is happening. The game is seperated in three phases. In the tycoon phase, you build your own pizzeria and play minigames. Then there's the office section, playing more like a classic Five nights at freddy's, you're stuck in a small office with two open vents on your right and left and a monitor infront of you which you use to complete tasks in order to end the night. You're armed with a flashlight but, it's basically useless since it won't le you see inside the vents and its more of a tool to possibly prevent the animatronics from getting you. In addition, the office can get quite warm, and in order to prevent passing out, the player has to keep the ventilation going, but the ventilation is really loud attracting the animatronics to your position. It is important in this game that you make barely any noise to not be in danger, which is almost impossible considering that tasks and ads that you accepted in the tycoon phase make a lot of noise. There are ways to defend yourself. The monitor is equipped with a scanner to track the animatronics' position, an audio system to attract animatronics to another position and a silent ventilation for obvious reasons. However, you can only keep one active and it's not a gurantee that they will work, so, when one of the animatronics approaches, your only hope is to shut off the ventilation and monitor and flash your light at the vent the noise is coming from. The animatronics that you will face are:

        <ul>
            <li>Scraptrap</li>
            <li>Scrap Baby</li>
            <li>Molten Freddy</li>
            <li>Lefty</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The way they get in the restaurant is through the third phase called salvage phase. This phase happens day by day. You're in a dimly lit room with a hostile animatrone on the other end of the table and you can choose to either throw it back into the alley where you found it or choose to salvage it for more money. If you choose to salvage it you need to complete a maintanance checklist while keeping an eye on the animatronic for any movement. If there is any movement it's best to shock the animatronic to prevent it from attacking but, you can only use it three times before it decreases the value. If the animatronic jumpscares you it will enter the pizzeria and you won't get payed. So, for one final time, can you survive?
