         <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        <p>
        Five nights at freddy's: Sister location was released in October 7th 2016 being the first Five nights at freddy's to completely change the formula. This game plays out more like a standard singleplayer campaign with scripted encounters that make the game five nights long with two quite intresting endings. As It's, probably, clear, this game focuses more on the story than the AI so, we can't really talk about it. However, due to fan outcry for a classic five nights at freddy's experience, Scott created a custom night that plays kind of like the original Five nights at freddy's with the power managment and doors that need closing for the player to survive with the addition of a vent that the player can close. That is where th similarities with the original stop, because this custom night has a lot more animatronics and a lot more mechanics which will be introduced in the AI section. For now, let's introduce the animatronics the player will face:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ballora</li>
            <li>Funtime Freddy</li>
            <li>Funtime Foxy</li>
            <li>Yenndo</li>
            <li>Bonnet</li>
            <li>Lolbit</li>
            <li>Minireenas</li>
            <li>Electrobab</li>
            <li>Bidybab</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            All this provides quite a challenge and the more challenges the player beats the more facts about the story are revealed making it a worthy challenge for everyone who wanted a more classic Five nights at freddy's playstyle.
