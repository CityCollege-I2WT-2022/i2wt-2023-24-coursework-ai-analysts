        <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        
        <p>
        Five nights at freddy's 3 was released in May 3rd 2015. Story wise, Five nights at freddy's 3 takes place 30 years after the original game, making it an actual sequel unlike Five nights at freddy's 2. Once again you are a security guard this time though, you're keeping watch of a horror attraction based on the rumors and legends of the old Freddy Fazbears Pizza. This time, there's only one animatronic that can kill you, called Springtrap, one of, lets say, more gruesome designs of the franchise since it is a rotting human body inside the suit but, let's ignore that since it doesn't have much significance when it comes to AI. Anyway, despite springtrap being the only animatronic that can kill you, that doesn't mean he's the only "animatronic" in the location. There's also phantom "animatronics" that are, basically, fragments of the protagonists' imagination come to life due to the bad ventilation of the building. Those are:</p>  
        
        <ul>
        <li>Phantom Freddy</li>
        <li>Phantom Chica</li>
        <li>Phantom Foxy</li>
        <li>Phantom Baloon Boy</li>
        <li>Phantom Manglre</li>
        <li>Phantom Puppet</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Speaking of bad installations, your cameras are also pretty terrible breaking every now and then making you have to reset them along with the ventilation through a maintenence panel, forcing you to take your sight of the cameras, making you vulnerable to springtrap. This also were the phantoms become a threat since, when they jumpscare you, instead of killing you, they either break your camera or your ventilation or both. The puppet is a special because, along with breaking your ventilation, it also blocks your vision making you even more vulnerable. Springtrap also has some tricks up his sleeve as he also utilizes the vents to get to your office faster and they only way to stop him is to seal the vent through the vent cameras that you can use to spot springtrap when he enters them. You don't have any doors or mask or flashlight to defend yourself, you only have an audio system, originally used to scare patrons, to distract him, however, it also breaks and has to be restarted through the maintanance panel. While similar in a play sense to the others it offers up its own set of challenges that the player has to conquer.
