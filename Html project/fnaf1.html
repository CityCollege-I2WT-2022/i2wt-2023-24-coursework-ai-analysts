        Five nights at freddy's is an indie mascot horror game created by Scott Cawthon and released in August 18th 2014. The game was created in Clickteam Fusion, a game and software creation engine that utilize a user-friendly drag and drop system, making it a very accesible engine for beginner and experienced programmers alike. The premise is, you work as a night-time security guard at Freddy Fazbears Pizza, a famous pizzaria back in the 80s that, due to certain events, has lost all the good will that it built up and now, its final restaurant is strangling to stay open. The company gained fame through their animatronic entertainers. Those are:

        <ul>
            <li>Bonnie the bunny</li>
            <li>Chica the Chicken</li>
            <li>Foxy the pirate fox</li>
            <li>Freddy Fazbear</li>
            <li>There is also a secret animatronic called Golden Freddy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        During the day it's a place for family fun and pizza, however, you're not there during the day. At night, the animatronics come alive and if they catch you, they'll try to forcefully stuff you inside one of the spare suits in the backroom. Suffice it to say, that will be a brutal end. You work from 12 am to 6am, your office is equipped with two heavy doors that can lock the animatronics out and you have a camera system that is used to keep tabs on them, there's two problems thought. There's blind spots on the camera and they happen to be right outside of the doors however, there are lights that you can use to spot the animatronics before they attack you. The other problem is a major one, the building runs on battery that constantly drains during the night. Which means the more you use the cameras and doors the faster it drains and, when you run out, only the clock can save you. So, there's one question, can you survive?

        This is the basic premise of the game and, although there's a lot more to the story, since this is focused on AI there's no reason to focus on the story.
