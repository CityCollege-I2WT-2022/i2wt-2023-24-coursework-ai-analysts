        <h1>Srategy Games</h1>

        <p>With roots in classic board games like Chess, strategy games are a well-liked game genre. The first strategy games, dubbed "Kriegspiele" (English for "wargames"), came out in the late 1700s with the goal of instructing cadets. Over the next two centuries, strategy games have been improved upon and developed into a kind of entertainment. The popular computer strategy games of today have a roots in the roleplaying and board games of the 20th century. Both the academic community and game producers have displayed renewed interest in procedural game content generation in recent years.</p>

        <p>Technical limitations prevented developers from providing their titles with an important amount of pre-designed game content when the first commercial computer games were released in the early 1980s. To save memory and storage space, game material such as levels, worlds, tales, weapons, and rivals had to be generated at program runtime. There are two reasons why creating game material "on the fly" has become more popular: Initially, the cost of producing games has increased significantly over the last 10 years because of the labor required to create the amount of content that players desire. By designing game content that adapts to the way a player plays a game, game makers try to find a way to customize their titles to suit the preferences of certain players.</p>

        <p>Digital strategy game production is already heavily influenced by artificial intelligence (AI), and this trend will only continue as technology advances. What effects will this have on consumers' gameplay experiences?</p>

        <ul>
                <li>Enhanced Gameplay</li>
                <li>Procedurally-Generated Content</li>
                <li>Improved Game Balancing</li>
                <li>Cooperative AI</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By using "game mechanics," we expand on the idea of "procedural game content generation." Here, "game mechanics" refers to topics like how in-game objects interact, the objective of the game, how players may influence the game world, etc. Using the Strategy Games Description Language (SGDL), a tree-based method for simulating strategy game concepts. In a strategy game, players must utilize their judgment and critical thinking skills to achieve a predetermined aim or objective. Popular digital strategy games include, for instance Age of Empires, Total War Series and Warcraft 3.</p>

        <p>The game that will be used as an example is named Warcraft III: Reforged. It's a pretty straight forward real time strategy game. Each player can pick one of the 4 differrent factions. Starts by building his base, training units by spending resources with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy's base. Each faction supports a variaty of differrent stractures and heroes with a mix of unique effects and abilities. The players gather resources which they spend them for training units or constructing buildings which provide effects or the ability to train or upgrade special stronger units. There two differrent resources; wood for buildings and gold for combat units</p>

        <p>The AI basically cheats. It knows what the player has at his disposal and tries to counter him. For this reason there are always differrent difficulties in the Options tab, which of course increases the amount of responsivness the AI has. The AI has complete visibility over the players actions which promts a reaction. This can comes with the form of making units that counter the player's unit combinations or by attacking valunarable spots in the player's defence.</p>
