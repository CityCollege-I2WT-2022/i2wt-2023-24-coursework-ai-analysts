        <p>In a strategy game, players must utilize their judgment and critical thinking skills to achieve a predetermined aim or objective. Popular digital strategy games include, for instance Age of Empires, Total War Series and Warcraft 3.</p>
        
        <p>Digital strategy game production is already heavily influenced by artificial intelligence (AI), and this trend will only continue as technology advances. What effects will this have on consumers' gameplay experiences? </p>

        <p>With roots in classic board games like Chess, strategy games are a well-liked game genre. The first strategy games, dubbed "Kriegspiele" (English for "wargames"), came out in the late 1700s with the goal of instructing cadets. Over the next two centuries, strategy games have been improved upon and developed into a kind of entertainment. The popular computer strategy games of today have a roots in the roleplaying and board games of the 20th century. 
        Both the academic community and game producers have displayed renewed interest in procedural game content generation in recent years.</p>  
        
        <p>Technical limitations prevented developers from providing their titles with an important amount of pre-designed game content when the first commercial computer games were released in the early 1980s. To save memory and storage space, game material such as levels, worlds, tales, weapons, and rivals had to be generated at program runtime. There are two reasons why creating game material "on the fly" has become more popular: Initially, the cost of producing games has increased significantly over the last 10 years because of the labor required to create the amount of content that players desire.  
        By designing game content that adapts to the way a player plays a game, game makers try to find a way to customize their titles to suit the preferences of certain players.</p>
        
        <p>By using "game mechanics," we expand on the idea of "procedural game content generation." Here, "game mechanics" refers to topics like how in-game objects interact, the objective of the game, how players may influence the game world, etc. We introduce the Strategy Games Description Language (SGDL), a tree-based method for simulating strategy game concepts. With SGDL, developers are able to rapidly prototype their ideas for games due to our customizable game engine 
        To demonstrate the language's potential and how to describe popular strategy game aspects, we give a number of example games.</p> 
        
        <p>Additionally, we offer techniques for procedurally creating and assessing the enjoyability of game mechanisms modeled in SGDL. We contend that by applying methods from the field of machine learning, the mechanics of strategy games can be evolved through an evolutionary process. Our findings demonstrate that algorithms can enhance the creativity of human game designers and that automated gameplay, when paired with expert knowledge, can be utilized to assess the quality of gameplay arising from SGDL-modeled game mechanics.</p>

        <p>Making the AI in action games act more human and be beatable is a difficulty because the AI opponent always has the natural advantage of perfect precision and lightning-fast reactions.In strategic games that rely on turns, the roles are reversed. The human player may quickly outsmart any AI opponent thanks to their cunning and intelligence; speed and accuracy are no longer significant considerations. Actually, it's really difficult to create an AI that can defeat a skilled player, but that isn't the main goal here.</p>
