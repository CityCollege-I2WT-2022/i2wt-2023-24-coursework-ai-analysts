        <h2>A brief description</h2>
        
        <p>
        Five nights at freddy's is an indie mascot horror game created by Scott Cawthon and released in August 18th 2014. The game was created in Clickteam Fusion, a game and software creation engine that utilize a user-friendly drag and drop system, making it a very accesible engine for beginner and experienced programmers alike. The premise is, you work as a night-time security guard at Freddy Fazbears Pizza, a famous pizzaria back in the 80s that, due to certain events, has lost all the good will that it built up and now, its final restaurant is struggling to stay open. The company gained fame through their animatronic entertainers. Those are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bonnie the bunny</li>
            <li>Chica the Chicken</li>
            <li>Foxy the pirate fox</li>
            <li>Freddy Fazbear</li>
            <li>There is also a secret animatronic called Golden Freddy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        During the day it's a place for family fun and pizza however, you're not there during the day. At night, the animatronics come alive and if they catch you, they'll try to forcefully stuff you inside one of the spare suits in the backroom. Suffice it to say, that will be a brutal end. You work from 12 am to 6am, your office is equipped with two heavy doors that can lock the animatronics out and you have a camera system that is used to keep tabs on them, there's two problems thought. There's blind spots on the camera and they happen to be right outside of the doors however, there are lights that you can use to spot the animatronics before they attack you. The other problem is a major one, the building runs on battery that constantly drains during the night. Which means the more you use the cameras and doors the faster it drains and, when you run out, only the clock can save you. So, there's only one question, can you survive?

        <p>
        This is the basic premise of the game and, although there's a lot more to the story, since this is focused on AI there's no reason to focus on the story.
        </p>
        
        <h3>AI</h3>
        <p>AI in five night's at freddy's works diffrently to other known horror games due to the limitations of Clickteam Fusion. It uses what's called a movement opportunity system which basically determines the movement of the animatronics throught the night. The AI levels of animatronics scale from 0 to 20 and, every 3-5 seconds the robots have a chance to move. During this, a random numer from 1 to 20 is chosen and, if it falls within the scale, the animatronic moves. For instance, if bonnie's scale is 5 and the number generated is from 1-5 then bonnie will move, however, if the number is between 6-20, bonnie won't move. The animatronics will start the first night at an AI level of 0 making them unable to move, something that will change as the nights get harder. However, during the night, from 2 to 4 AM, the animatronics will increase their level by 1. Their behaviour is also something important, bonnie will exit the show stage and navigate the building through the left side while chica will move in the right side. Freddy will also move through the right side however, he can't be seen using the lights. It is also important to point out that Foxy works diffrently than the others. Instead of moving through the right or left side of the pizzaria like Freddy, Chica and Bonnie, he leaves his own special area(the pirate cove) through phases. In the first phase, Foxy is inside the pirate cove, in the second phase, he is seen peeking through the curtains, in the third, he is outside the pirate cove and in the fourth and final phase, he runs down the left hallway and this is where the player needs to close the door or else get jumpscared. So, their night AI would look something like this:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Night 1:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 0-3<br>
            Chica AI: 0-2<br>
            Freddy AI: 0<br>
            Foxy AI: 0-2</li><br>
            
            <li>Night 2:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 3-6<br>
            Chica AI: 1-3<br>
            Freddy AI: 0<br>
            Foxy AI: 1-3</li><br>
            
            <li>Night 3:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 0-3<br>
            Chica AI: 5-7<br>
            Freddy AI: 1<br>
            Foxy AI: 2-4</li><br>
            
            <li>Night 4:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 2-5<br>
            Chica AI: 4-6<br>
            Freddy AI: 1-2<br>
            Foxy AI: 6-8</li><br>
            
            <li>Night 5:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 5-8<br>
            Chica AI: 7-9<br>
            Freddy AI: 3<br>
            Foxy AI: 5-7</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Congratulations! You have just beaten five nights at freddy's. After 6 AM hits you're greeted with a paycheck and taken back to the main menu, finally done with a quite scary experience... Yeah, that doesn't happen. Instead, you realise that the game has a sixth night which not only goes against its name but it's also way harder than the previous night. Choose to continue with night 6 and you really realise how difficult the game can be. The animatronics are incredibly aggresive their AI reaching a high.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Night 6:<br>
            Bonnie AI: 10-13<br>
            Chica AI: 12-14<br>
            Freddy AI: 4<br>
            Foxy AI: 6-8</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, the sixth night is over. At the end, you're given 50 cents of overtime and are greated in the menu with a seventh night.</p> 
        
        <h4>Custom night:</h4>
        <p>Yeah, it's not over just yet. Night 7 is called a custom night where you can customize the AI levels of the animatronics. The heardest challenge required to fully complete the game is 4/20 mode which basically means all AI levels are on 20, guaranteeing that the movement opportunities will always be successful. There's no point in showing how they improve throught the night, since the animatronics are already at the maximum level they could be. After finishing the seventh night, the player character will be fired and you'll have fully completed five nights at Freddy's! </p>
        
        <h5>Golden freddy:</h5>
        <p>Golden freddy is intresting as he's more of an easter egg that can kill you rather than an actual animatronic you can customize. It's not exactly clear how golden Freddy works, however, the running theory is that there is a 0.001% chance that he will appear in the players' office. If the player is quick enough and opens the cameras he won't be harmed otherwise, he'll be jumpscared and the game will crash. </p>
